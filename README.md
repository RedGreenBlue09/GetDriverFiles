# GetDriverFiles

Used to list all files required for a driver INF.

### Unimplemented features

Disk specific path defined in `[SourceDisksNames]`. The program assumes the root of all disks is the installation root.  
Reason: I don't need it at the moment. If anyone wants this to be implemented, please file an issue.
